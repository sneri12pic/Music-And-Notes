## How to Run the Application

### 1. Setup
To run this web application, you will need a local or remote server to handle file uploads and serve the content.

- **Option 1: Use Python's HTTP Server** (if you don't have a server already):
  - Open a terminal/command prompt.
  - Navigate to the project folder and run the following command:
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server
    ```
  - This will start a simple server at `http://localhost:8000`.

- **Option 2: Use Node.js**:
  - You can also use a Node.js server or any web server (e.g., Express) to handle uploads.

### 2. Features Usage
- **Music Player**: 
  - Upload an audio file using the file input in the "Music Tab".
  - The audio file will appear in the list, and you can click on it to play.
  - Use the previous, play/pause, and next buttons to control the playback.
  - The volume slider allows you to adjust the volume.
  
- **Note Taking**:
  - Type your notes in the "Writing Page".
  - Use the **Bold** and **Italic** buttons to apply text formatting.

- **PDF Viewer**:
  - Upload a PDF file using the file input in the "PDF Viewer" section.
  - The PDF will be rendered in the iframe for viewing.

### 3. Resizing
You can adjust the width of the **Music Tab** and **PDF Viewer** sections using the resizable divs (`<div class="resizer">`) placed between the sections. Click and drag the resizer to resize the columns.

## Dependencies
- **Bootstrap** (via CDN): For basic styling and layout.
- **jQuery** (via CDN): Used for DOM manipulation (though in this case, it's only needed for Bootstrapâ€™s dependencies).
- **Popper.js** (via CDN): Required for Bootstrap's dynamic components (e.g., tooltips).

## Browser Support
This application supports modern browsers such as:
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Safari

### Known Limitations:
- The PDF viewer might not work optimally in all browsers.
- Some features (like drag-and-drop file uploads) could be added in future versions.

## License
This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
